### Project Description
I completed this project for my first code review at Epicodus.

As stated in the prompt from Epicodus, the project objectives are to:

* The following HTML tags are all used: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, and span.
* Bootstrap classes are used to style the page. This means explicitly using classes mentioned on this page, not just linking in the Bootstrap stylesheet.
* Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses typography styles, cascading, the box model, and floats.
* Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary  comments and debugging tools.
* Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦"
* The project repo contains a README that includes:
    1. author name
    2. project or program name
    3. description of program
    4. program setup instructions
    5. link to site on GitHub Pages
    6. copyright and license information
* Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* Required content was in place by the Friday deadline.
* Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

_I hope I've accomplished all of this!_

### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

### Project Setup instructions
There shouldn't be any special setup required. If something doesn't display correctly (like this email address--still working on that!) or goes wrong somehow, please contact me at [mailto:lara.m.bjork@gmail.com](lara.m.bjork@gmail.com) and I will do my best to troubleshoot for you.

### Known Issues
* Email link in this README as noted above.
* Although there is responsive sizing in place, this project is best viewed on standard desktop. It was not tested on a large desktop, and there appear to be some issues with sizing for tables and phones.
* Two of the images are not displaying in the GitHub page, as commented on in the HTML file. The alt text appears, but in Chrome, it is sometimes rotated.
