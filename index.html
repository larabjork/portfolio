    <h1>Hi there.</h1>
    <p>I'm Lara Bjork, and these are some of the projects I've started as a student at Epicodus, as well as a little bit of information about me.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Before I signed up for the Epicodus program, I had been a grant writer and technical editor for 18 years. That's a long time spent meeting deadlines and attending to details. I was drawn to coding because there's always something to learn, because I like solving logic puzzles, and because I still really like working at a detailed level but zooming out to get the big picture, too.</p>
