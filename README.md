### Project Description
I completed this project for my first code review at Epicodus.

As stated in the prompt from Epicodus, the project objectives are to:

* The following HTML tags are all used: p, h, ul, ol, li, em, strong, a, img, div, and span.
* Bootstrap classes are used to style the page. This means explicitly using classes mentioned on this page, not just linking > in the Bootstrap stylesheet.
* Project includes a custom-made stylesheet that uses typography styles, cascading, the box model, and floats.
* Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary > comments and debugging tools.
* Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦"
* The project repo contains a README that includes:
    1. author name
    2. project or program name
    3. description of program
    4. program setup instructions
    5. link to site on GitHub Pages
    6. copyright and license information
* Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* Required content was in place by the Friday deadline.
* Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor > > using the correct terminology.
